Just a fun little project because the first chapter of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) told me to.

It's probably not even remotely memory safe but i did the best i could.

If for some god-unknown reason you want to contribute to this or use it, go ahead, maybe i'll try to improve it when i have time.
